# Sans Caret

## Overview
This uses yarn.lock to disambiguate tildes & carets in package.json files.

## Installation
Dirty up that global node space with:
`npm install caret-bare -g`

## Usage
Navigate to your project & execute
`caret-bare`

After you're done, nuke out _node_modules_ and reinstall.

## To Note
This package.json contains no carets.

## Todos
I'm sure there are edge cases that won't be covered by this that require human intervention. Open to options on how to best handle those.
